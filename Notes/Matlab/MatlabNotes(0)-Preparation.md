# Matlab Notes (0): Preparation

## Intro

I have been using Matlab for a while, but haven't made any notes on it yet. To document what I learned and help me review them in the future, I am taking Matlab Notes here.

## Roadmap 

Follow the oficial tutorials [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2019b/matlab/graphics.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav) as the main learning path and recources, supplemented by CSDN and 知乎. You can also refer to the official online video tutorials [here](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?page=1&sort=featured) if you have an license.


## Else 

For more advanced functions and tips, you can refer to the [Matlab --> File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange) and [Matlab --> Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/).
