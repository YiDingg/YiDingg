## About The Site

### What Is This Site

This site is a collection of my notes, blogs and documents. It is maintained by myself, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Refer to [Build Your Personal Website](Blogs/Mixed/BuildYourSite.md) if you also want to build your own website.

Click the button at the bottom left or go to [Navgation Page](_sidebar.md) for the table of contents.

### About Blogs

Our notes, blogs and documents are written with Notability, Markdown or Latex, following [_WSETD (Writing Standards of Easy-read Technical Document)_](Projects\WSETD\OutlineOfWSETD.md). Unless otherwise specified, all the blogs, articles, notes and documents are licensed under [_CC BY-NC 4.0_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en) license agreement. Commercial use is prohibited and please indicate the source when reprinting.

To create a new blog, some that need a lot of graphs are taken by Markdown + HTML on VSCode or Typora. Some that need numerous formula to derive the conclusions are written by Latex on VSCode, displayed in PDF format. The rest will be written with Markdown or Notability, displayed in PDF format.

After one stage's learning, I will compress and backup most of my notes and textbooks, then upload them to the cloud.

By the way, I am trying to write notes in English as a practice.
