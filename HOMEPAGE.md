## About The Site

### What Is This Site

This site is a collection of my notes, blogs and documents. It is maintained by myself, hosted on GitHub Pages. If you encountered into any problems or bugs while visiting the site, please visit [GitHub > YiDingg](https://github.com/YiDingg) and submit an issue. Sincere thanks.

Refer to [Build Your Personal Website](Blogs/Mixed/BuildYourSite.md) if you also want to build your own website.

### Navgation Page

Click the button at the bottom left or go to [Navgation Page](_sidebar.md) for the table of contents.

### Notes and Blogs

Our notes, blogs and documents are written with Notability, Markdown or Latex, following [WSETD (Writing Standards of Easy-read Technical Document)](Projects\WSETD\OutlineOfWSETD.md). Unless otherwise specified, all the blogs, articles, notes and documents are licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en) license agreement. You can freely download and share them but commercial use is prohibited. Please indicate the source when reprinting.

Refer to my [GitHub > LatexNotes](https://github.com/YiDingg/LatexNotes) for all the notes and documents written in Latex.

As for blogs, some that need a lot of graphs are taken by Markdown + HTML on VSCode or Typora. Some that need numerous formula to derive the conclusions are written by Latex on VSCode, displayed in PDF format. The rest will be written with Markdown or Notability, displayed in PDF format.

After one stage's learning, I will compress and backup most of my notes and textbooks, then upload them to the cloud.

By the way, I am trying to write notes in English as a practice.
