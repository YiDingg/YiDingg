## Site Structure

Our notes, blogs and documents are Written by Notability, Markdown or Latex, following [*Writing Standards of Easy-read Technical Document*](Projects\WSETD\OutlineOfWSETD.md). 

Some that need a lot of graphs are taken by Markdown + HTML on VSCode or Typora. 
Some that need numerous formula to derive the conclusions are written by Latex on VSCode, displayed in PDF format. 
The rest will be written on Notability, displayed in PDF format. 

By the way, I am trying to write notes in English as a practice.
