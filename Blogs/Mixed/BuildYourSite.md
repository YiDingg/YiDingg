# Build Your Personal Website

## Introduction

This is a guide on how to build your personal website.

Before we [start](Blogs/Mixed/BuildYourSite?id=quick-start), it is of great importance to kown what a personal website is, how it works, what you can obtain by having one, and what a site costs.

### What Is a Personal Website

A personal website is a website that is designed and developed specifically for you. It is a space on the internet where you can showcase your work, notes, blogs and personal information. It is a place where you can express yourself, interact with others, and share your ideas.

### How Does It Work

A personal website is a site with URL (Uniform Resource Locator, the address of the site) hosted by a internet server, and anyone can access it if you did not restrict access to it. We also called the URL as domain (域名).

You have to filing your website domain if you are deploying it on a domestic server.


### What Can You Get

1. A personal website is a great way to showcase your work and skills. You can post your projects, write blogs, and share your ideas with the world.

2. A personal website can be a great way to build your reputation. People will see your work and skills, and they will trust you more.

3. A personal website can be a great way to network with people. You can find people with similar interests and share your ideas with them.

4. A personal website can be a great way to attract new visitors. You can advertise your services, products, or events, and attract visitors to your website.



### What Does It Costs

You can build your site <span style='color:red'>completely freely</span> by using free hosting services, including [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), etc. In this case, all you need is to design your site and update your site contents. Our site is now deployed by GitHub Pages as there are plenty of nice free plugins.

By the way, we have to note that building a longtime, well-designed and constantly updated website is not an easy task. It costs lots of time and efforts. It's crucial to have the right tools and knowledge to make the process as smooth as possible, or you may give up halfway after trying for a while.

## Quick Start

To get started, we advise you to use GitHub Pages (host server) + docsify (static site generator). In this case, you can use the given domain name completely freely. You do not need to buy a domain name or a hosting server, and you do not have to register and filing you website domain.

## Go Deep 

Before go deep into the details, it is highly recommended to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are completely new with these languages, we advise you to learn them first, in case of making useless efforts during the building process.

### Choose a Generator
You might be wondering how to manage your site contents. Actually most of our blogs, tutorials, and documentations are written in Markdown format. They are converted to HTML files and further to a static website so that they can be deployed on the server, displayed on the internet eventurally.

Docsify is the very tool that convert your files (most are Markdown) to a static website. It is completely open-source and free, with a nice community and plenty of plugins.
And Our site is based on it. 

Ofcourse, you can use other tools like Hugo, [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/), etc. But Docsify is a good choice for our purpose.

### Download to Modify

Thanks to all the open-scource tools, and we can easily download the scource code and modify to fit your needs.
