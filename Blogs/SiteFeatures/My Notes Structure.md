# My Notes Structure

My notes, blogs, project documents are based on Notability, Markdown and Latex. 
Some notes that need a lot of colorful pictures are taken by Markdown+HTML on Typora+VSCode. 
Some notes that need numerous formula to derive the conclusions are taken by Latex on VSCode, displayed in PDF format. 
The rest will be written on Notability, displayed in PDF format. 

We write technical articles under [《中文技术文档写作规范》](https://github.com/ruanyf/document-style-guide).

By the way, I am trying to write notes in English  as a practice.
