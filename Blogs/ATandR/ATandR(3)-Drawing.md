# ATandR(3): Drawing 

The creation of visual aids like graphs, flowcharts, and illustrations can be a crucial component of various projects. In this context, we will explore some of freely available and impressive tools to facilitate your development. And all of their graphs can be exported as vector graphics, which really meets my habit.

## Flow Chart and Diagram

- [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/)

You can't miss draw.io if you are creating a flowchart or something similar. Draw.io is a free, online, and easy-to-use tool. You must be into it once you have a try.

- [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/classic)
- [Mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io/editor)


### AxGlyph

AxGlyph is a versatile vector-drawing software. I always use it to create physical illustrations, simple data charts and plots. Although it is charged (￥36 for permanent use), it is totally wroth the price and I highlyrecommend it.

### Mathcha

The graphs in Mathcha can be exported in PDF very easily. It might be a good choice when you need to insert the graphs into the Latex file. But I think the only downside is that its math formula font is not as beautiful as the one in Latex.

### Geogebra

Geogebra is a powerful tool for creating and manipulating mathematical objects, including 3D objects, surfaces, and curves. It is a free, open-source and cross-platform software.
