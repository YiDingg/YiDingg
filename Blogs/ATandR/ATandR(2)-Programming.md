# ATandR(1): Programming

Here are some tools and recources for programming. You do not need to use all of them but to choose several to promote your programming journey. And you are expected to browse the TOC before reading, in order to find the most suitable tools for your needs.

## Programming Language

Obviously, there are an ocean of programming tools and resources on the internet. But which is the best, or the most suitable for you? It depends on your stages, goals and your level of expertise. Here are some general tips.

There can be several stages for one programming language: learning, practicing, working. Learning means you are barely new to it. Practicing stands for that you have leart it before and you want to make some progress. Working tells that you are doing a project.

### Learning

For learning one programming language, we recommand the following free resources:
- [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) (highly recommanded): a community effort to create roadmaps, guides and other educational content to help guide developers in picking up a path and guide their learnings.
- [Runoob (菜鸟网站)](https://www.runoob.com/): you must know it.
- [Free Programming Books](https://ebookfoundation.github.io/free-programming-books-search/?&sect=books&file=free-programming-books-zh.md): freely available programming books/e-books/online courses.
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/): develop fluency in 70 programming languages with the unique blend of learning, practice and mentoring.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com): the world's largest web developer site.

Before starting one language, it is suggested to make plan, including the learning path, tools, and resources. You can try some recources above and choose the most suitable ones for you.

You can also refer to the following resources for web development:
- [HTML & CSS](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/)
- [W3Schools (English)](https://www.w3schools.com): world's largest web developer site. You can learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, Python here, also find reference materials, tutorials, and examples.
- [W3Schools (中文)](https://www.w3school.com.cn): 中文版的 w3schools，包含 HTML、CSS、JavaScript、SQL、PHP、Python 等教程，以及参考和示例。
- [Mozilla (English)](https://developer.mozilla.org): Mozilla's official website for learning web development. 
- [Mozilla (中文)](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN): 中文版的 Mozilla 开发者网站，包含学习 Web 开发的各类资源。
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/madzadev/pen/zYdOVPV): Edit and preview HTML+CSS+JS online, share your code and find others' creations.
- [CSS Challenges](https://css-challenges.com): 
- [CSS Generator](https://css-generators.com): 
- [CSS Tip](https://css-tip.com):
- [CSS Inspiration](https://csscoco.com/inspiration)

By the way, if you are a CS (Computer Science) student or you want to be a software engineer, you can refer to [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) and [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/main/translations/README-cn.md) for more specific advices and resources. [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/main/translations/README-cn.md) is a multi-month study plan for becoming a software engineer for a large company. If you are interested in being a software engineer, you can follow it's roadmap and find some knowledge extension on it.

### Practicing

Use the following resources to practice your programming skills.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/)
