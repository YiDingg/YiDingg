# ATandR(1): Markdown

As I am writing most of my blogs in Markdown, I have tried several Markdown editors to see which one is the best. Eventually, I settled on VSCode. Yes, you heard me right. VScode, a code editor instead of a text editor. 

As usual, We will give the conclusions first. In the later contents, I will tell you why, and explain some tips to make your writing experience more enjoyable.

## Conclusions

We use VSCode as the Markdown editor. Here are the extensions you may need.

Necessary extensions:
- Markdown All in One: and the main extension.
- VS-PicGo: upload the image to the cloud, rename it as you want and insert the link automatically.
- Pangu-Markdown: let your content into a better format.

Other extensions:
- Markdown Preview Enhanced
- PlantUML
- Image preview


## Why VSCode

One of the reasons is that I'd like to edit all my files in one place, instead of openning several editors and shifting between them frequently. For example, I may need to edit `.md`, `.html`,`.css` and `.js` files at the same time. Another reason is that, it is comfortable to edit Markdown in VSCode as long as you configure the appropriate enviroment, such as font, color scheme and some awesome extensions. The last one is absolutely outstanding -- extensions, I highly recommend you pangu-plungin and VS-PicGo as I am so into to them.

It is obvious that one excellent Markdown should meet:
- Free: Limited-free is tolerable but completely free is better. 
- Beautiful and comfortable: you can choose or customize one pretty theme and edit your files in a beautiful and comfortable way.
- Cross-platfor: support Windows, Linux and macOS.
- WYSIWYG: WYSIWYG stading for "What You See Is What You Get", aka the real-time preview.

Before using VSCode for markdown, I have tried several other editors including Typora and Marktext. They two are recently most popular editors for Markdown editing. 

As for Typora, it do be a great editor. For me, I often need to add a photo into my blog so I used a plugin called "PicGo" to upload the photo to the cloud and insert the link into the Markdown file. When uploading, I hope the plugin can rename it automatically as `{currentTime}_{fileName}{extName}`, such as `2024-07-10-12-46-55_HOMEPAGE.jpg`. However, I didn't find anyway to do this in PicGo for Typora (up to 2024-7-11). Instead, VS-Picgo, PicGo for VScode, did this perfectly. 

As for Marktext, it is the same reason. I need upload and rename automatically but Marktext can not do that.

Another reason is what I mentioned before -- I do not like to open several editors and shift frequently.

After swiching to VSCode, I found another awesome extensions called "Pangu-Markdown". One of its features is to automatically add spaces between Chinese and English words, which is so useful. Here is a brief view:
