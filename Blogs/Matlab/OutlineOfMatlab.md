# Outline of Matlab Notes

I have been using Matlab for a while, but haven't made any notes on it yet. To document what I learned and help me review them in the future, I am taking Matlab Notes here.

## Roadmap 

Follow the oficial tutorials [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2019b/matlab/graphics.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav) as the main learning path and recources, supplemented by CSDN and 知乎. You can also refer to the official online video tutorials [here](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?page=1&sort=featured) if you have an license.
